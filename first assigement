Exercise 1: Comments
Write a program that prints your name and includes both single-line and multi-line comments explaining what each part of your code does.

solution:
# This is a simple Python program to print my name
# Define the name to be printed
name = "ChatGPT"  # Assigning the name "ChatGPT" to the variable 'name'
# Print the name to the console
print(name)  # Output the value of 'name' to the screen

'''
This program consists of:
1. A variable 'name' that stores the name as a string.
2. A print statement that displays the value of 'name'.
'''



Exercise 2: Error Identification
Below is a piece of code with some intentional errors. Identify and correct the errors. Explain the type of error for each correction made.
print("Welcome to Python!"
result = 10 / 0              
my_list = [1, 2, 3
print(my_list[3])

solution:
print("Welcome to Python!"
result = 10 / 0              
my_list = [1, 2, 3
print(my_list[3])

Exercise 3: Variable Assignment
Create a program that:
Assign your name (string), age (integer), height (float), and whether you are a student (boolean) to variables.
Prints each variable with an appropriate message.

solution:

# Variable assignments
name = "ChatGPT"       
age = 2                
height = 1.75          
is_student = False     

# Printing each variable with an appropriate message
print("Name:", name)                    # Output the name
print("Age:", age)                      # Output the age
print("Height:", height, "meters")     # Output the height with units
print("Are you a student?", is_student) # Output the student status

Exercise 4: Descriptive Variable Names
Rewrite the following code using descriptive variable names:

a = 5
b = 10
c = a * b

solutin:

# Assigning values to descriptive variable names
first_number = 5                
second_number = 10             
# Calculating the product of the two numbers
product_of_numbers = first_number * second_number
# Output the result
print("The product of", first_number, "and", second_number, "is", product_of_numbers)

Exercise 5: Numeric Types and Operations
Perform the following operations and print the results:
Add two integers
Subtract a float from an integer
Multiply a float by a complex number
Divide an integer by zero (observe and write down the error)

solution:

# Operation 1: Add two integers
integer_one = 10
integer_two = 5
sum_result = integer_one + integer_two
print("Addition of two integers:", sum_result)
# Operation 2: Subtract a float from an integer
integer_value = 10
float_value = 2.5
subtraction_result = integer_value - float_value
print("Subtraction of a float from an integer:", subtraction_result)
# Operation 3: Multiply a float by a complex number
float_number = 3.0
complex_number = 2 + 4j
multiplication_result = float_number * complex_number
print("Multiplication of a float by a complex number:", multiplication_result)
# Operation 4: Divide an integer by zero (will cause an error)

Exercise 6: Built-in Functions
Write a program that:
Takes a list of numbers as input from the user.
Uses the abs(), max(), and min() functions to find the absolute values, maximum, and minimum of the numbers.
Prints the results with appropriate messages.
Example input: [-5, 3.2, -1, 0, 12]


solution:

# Get input from the user
user_input = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by commas (e.g., -5, 3.2, -1, 0, 12): ")
# Convert the input string into a list of numbers
number_list = [float(num) for num in user_input.split(',')]
# Calculate the absolute values
absolute_values = [abs(num) for num in number_list]
# Find the maximum and minimum values
maximum_value = max(number_list)
minimum_value = min(number_list)
# Print the results
print("Original list of numbers:", number_list)
print("Absolute values:", absolute_values)
print("Maximum value:", maximum_value)
print("Minimum value:", minimum_value)

Exercise 7: Arithmetic Operations
Create a simple calculator program that:
Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
Asks the user to select an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
Performs the selected operation and prints the result. Handle division by zero gracefully.

solution:

# Function to perform the selected operation
def calculator():
    # Prompt the user to enter two numbers
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    
    # Ask the user to select an operation
    print("Select an operation:")
    print("1. Addition (+)")
    print("2. Subtraction (-)")
    print("3. Multiplication (*)")
    print("4. Division (/)")
    
    operation = input("Enter the number of the operation (1/2/3/4): ")
    
    # Perform the selected operation
    if operation == '1':
        result = num1 + num2
        print("Result:", result)
    elif operation == '2':
        result = num1 - num2
        print("Result:", result)
    elif operation == '3':
        result = num1 * num2
        print("Result:", result)
    elif operation == '4':
        # Handle division by zero
        if num2 == 0:
            print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
        else:
            result = num1 / num2
